SUDO

For tasks that require access to the pihole executable to work, such as editing
groups, you need to add a rule to allow the pihole user to access it without
password via sudo. Simple way to do this:

echo 'pihole ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pihole' > /etc/sudoers.d/pihole

This file is installed by default by the package. Be sure permissions are set
correctly:

chmod 0600 /etc/sudoers.d/pihole
chown root. /etc/sudoers.d/pihole

TEMPERATURE READING

To make the temperature reading more predictable, a patch is applied to allow
for an environment variable HWMON_NAME which is read from the $_SERVER array.
The value should be something like coretemp or k10temp. You can see the name in
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name.

If you are using PHP-FPM, you can set a line like so for the group in the
configuration:

[pihole]
...
env[HWMON_NAME] = k10temp

If you are using Apache, you can set it like so:

<VirtualHost hostname:80>
  ...
  SetEnv HWMON_NAME k10temp
  ...
</VirtualHost>

DEBUG LOG

To have the 'Generate debug log' feature work fully, add a file
/etc/pihole/debug-vars with content like the following:

BLOCK_PAGE_HOST="https://block-page-host"
DASHBOARD_HOST="https://dashboard-host"

This file is sourced with Bash so it can do anything but ideally should
try not to mess with the environment. You can pass basic authentication
user:password in the URIs if necessary.

BLOCK_PAGE_HOST is optional and can be an empty string. In that case, the debug
log generator will not check for a block page.

To pass the check, the block page must have the X-Pi-hole header set:

X-Pi-hole: A black hole for Internet advertisements.
