Subject: [PATCH 14/19] bpo-36384: Leading zeros in IPv4 addresses are no
 longer tolerated (GH-25099) (GH-25815)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Reverts commit e653d4d8e820a7a004ad399530af0135b45db27a and makes
parsing even more strict. Like socket.inet_pton() any leading zero
is now treated as invalid input.
