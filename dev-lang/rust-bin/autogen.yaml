          # https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/04/09/updates-to-rusts-wasi-targets.html
          # Starting in Rust 1.78 (May 2nd, 2024) a new wasm32-wasip1 target will become available.
          # Starting Rust 1.81 (September 5th, 2024) we will begin warning existing users of wasm32-wasi to migrate to wasm32-wasip1
          # And finally in Rust 1.84 (January 9th, 2025) the wasm32-wasi target will no longer be shipped on the stable release channel
          # After the Rust 1.78.0 release, we can replace wasm32-wasi with wasm32-wasip1

          # https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/releases.html#version-1840-2025-01-09
          # Support for the target named wasm32-wasi has been removed as the target is now named wasm32-wasip1.
          # This completes the transition plan for this target following the introduction of wasm32-wasip1 in Rust 1.78.
          # Compiler warnings on use of wasm32-wasi introduced in Rust 1.81 are now gone as well as the target is removed.
