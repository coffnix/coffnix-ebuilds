Per FL-4990. Now, xorg-proto of version 2018.04 is a monolithic package that installing lots of proto binaries, which existed as separate single ebuilds. It
's compatibitly with older xorg-server is untested. This ebuild added as is from gentoo and passed through into xorg kit due to new name, which, then caused a block with standalone proto ebuilds, which are yet part of maintained X.Org branches. Many ebuilds that does not belong to any kit but depend on *proto* binaries (follow FL-4990) now started to depend on monolithic ebuild. Due to fact Funtoo still has the separate proto ebuilds, this particular ebuild is added as meta ebuild, which then, depends on separate ebuilds. 

The procedure for updating this ebuild whenever is new X.Org branch added is following. Convert xorg-proto to be a real package with revision bump, which then, has runtime blockers on older standalone *proto* ebuilds. Apply package.mask for all standalone proto ebuilds. This gives clean straightforward update.
